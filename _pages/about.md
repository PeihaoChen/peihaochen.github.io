<br />
I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Software Engineering at South China University of Technology, advised by Prof. [Mingkui Tan](https://tanmingkui.github.io/) and Prof. [Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/). I engage in developing an agent that can understand and interact with the multi-modal world. Toward this goal, my research mainly focus on:

* <b>Embodied AI</b>: Visual Navigation; Robot Manipulation
* <b>Multi-Modal Video Understanding</b>: Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning; Temporal Action Localization; Visually-Aligned Sound Generation

<!-- * My primary research interests are in <b>Visual Understanding</b> and mainly focus on:
  * <b>Video Understanding</b>: self-supervised video representation learning, temporal action localization;
  * <b>Embodied AI</b>: vision-and-language navigation; -->

I am currently <span style="color: red;">seeking opportunities in a company</span> specializing in embodied AI or multi-modal video understanding. If you have a suitable position available, please feel free to contact me.
