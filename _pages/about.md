Hell,我是贾钰杰，很高兴认识你。
I am a third-year undergraduate student in the School of Software Engineering at South China University of Technology. I engage in developing an agent that can understand and interact with the multi-modal world. Toward this goal, my research mainly focus on:

* <b>Embodied AI</b>: Visual Navigation; Dexterous manipulation; 
* <b>Multi-Modal Large Models</b>: Multi-Agent Systems; Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); Knowledge Refinement for Long-Text Data

<!-- * My primary research interests are in <b>Visual Understanding</b> and mainly focus on:
  * <b>Video Understanding</b>: self-supervised video representation learning, temporal action localization;
  * <b>Embodied AI</b>: vision-and-language navigation; -->

<!-- I am currently <span style="color: red;">seeking opportunities in a company</span> specializing in embodied AI or multi-modal video understanding. If you have a suitable position available, please feel free to contact me.  -->
I am currently seeking internship opportunities in the fields of embodied AI or multi-modal large language models. If you have a suitable position available, please feel free to contact me.
